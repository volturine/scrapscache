# Architecture

Scraps Cache is a **single-page notes client** plus an optional **opaque sync relay**.
The same SvelteKit app serves the UI and the sync API when self-hosted.

## Design principles

1. **Offline-first** — IndexedDB is the durable source of truth on each device.
2. **Ciphertext relay** — the server stores slots of encrypted blobs; it never
   receives note plaintext, labels, or attachment bytes.
3. **Native deployment** — self-hosting uses two local sqld stores; Cloudflare
   uses D1 metadata, R2 ciphertext objects, and a per-account Durable Object.
4. **Client-side crypto** — sync keys, backup passphrases, and encryption live
   in the browser using audited primitives (`@noble/*`, CPace).

### Local data model (conceptual)

- **Notes** — title, body (plain text + checklist lines), color, pins, archive,
  trash, reminder timestamp, label IDs, attachments. Every change goes through
  `applyNoteEdit` in `src/lib/model/`, which stamps only the fields it changes,
  on the relay-corrected clock. The body is also a Yjs document, so concurrent
  edits from two devices merge; attachments merge by id with removals
  remembered; other fields are last-write-wins per field, ties broken by writer.
- **Reminder wakes** — optional account-scoped opaque wake IDs and `fireAt`
  timestamps. Each enabled device has independent delivery state, and a device
  does not need the encrypted note before receiving a generic alert. The relay
  never receives note IDs or text.
- **Labels** — named tags with update timestamps for conflict resolution.
- **Boards** — kanban structures + tombstones for cross-device deletion.
- **Sync outbox** — changed record keys scheduled for upload (not a full
  mirror of every field into `localStorage`).
- **Attachments** — full bytes loaded when needed; grid/list may keep thumbnails
  only in memory.

### Sync identity

From a random 32-byte sync key the client derives:

- an Ed25519 signing key; only its public key is registered with the relay
- `accountId` — the stable v1 server-visible account handle derived from the sync key
- One-time pairing code — random 80-bit rendezvous code, shown only while connecting another device

Payload encryption key material is also derived from the sync key. The server
verifies signed one-time challenges and issues 30-minute sessions, but cannot
decrypt envelopes.

Accounts created before proof-of-possession authentication upgrade automatically
replace their stored scrypt credential with the public key after one final legacy
authentication. The account ID and encrypted relay data do not move.

### Workspaces

A device can hold several **workspaces**. Each one owns its own isolated
dataset, so datasets never mix and switching is a pointer change plus an
in-memory reload rather than a copy. Every workspace is either private (no sync
key, never talks to the relay) or synced, and any workspace can move between the
two without its notes moving:

- **Sync this workspace** registers a fresh sync key for that same workspace.
- **Unlink** drops the sync key on this device and keeps the notes as a private
  workspace; the cloud copy and other devices are untouched.
- **Delete cloud data** deletes the relay account, then unlinks.
- **Delete workspace** removes it and its notes from this device. Deleting the
  last workspace leaves a fresh empty one.

The first workspace on a device uses the original `scrapscache` database; the
others use `scrapscache-profile-<id>`. That is a storage detail only: the
first workspace is an ordinary keyring entry with the same actions as any other.

The keyring itself — id, display name, and sync key per workspace — is held in
`localStorage`; see the residual-risk note in
[security.md](security.md#out-of-scope--residual-risk).

### Opaque envelopes

Each synced logical record is uploaded as:

- **slot** — opaque client-chosen identifier for “this logical thing”
- **id** — operation / version identity for idempotent retries
- **ciphertext** — authenticated encrypted blob

The relay can replace or delete by slot without learning whether the payload is
a note, image, label, or board. The storage quota is ciphertext plus estimated
per-record database overhead (default 100 MB).

Each synced record keeps a rolling window of its newest encrypted versions, the
live one included: 14 by default, set with `SCRAPSCACHE_HISTORY_VERSIONS` (1–40).
Saving a new version drops the oldest; one record's saves never evict another's.
Older versions count toward the account's storage quota alongside live records,
but never block them: when the two together exceed the quota, the account's
oldest versions give way. A deleted record's versions do not count, like the
deleted copy kept during its grace. The daily retention sweep recounts history usage from the
stored versions.
The note editor loads a note's versions in one request, previews a selected
version, and restores it to that note. A device decrypts the version and any
matching attachments in memory; history is never written into IndexedDB. When a
record is deleted for good, its history goes with it once the deleted-record
grace (14 days) ends, and account deletion removes all history and its
ciphertext.
