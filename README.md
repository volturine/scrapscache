# Scraps Cache

**Scraps Cache** is a self-hostable notes app with **end-to-end encrypted** multi-device
sync. Pins, labels, reminders, checklists, attachments, kanban boards,
trash/archive — with a ciphertext-only relay for ordinary device sync. Optional hosted MCP is
a separate, explicitly enabled trust path that lets an AI provider access notes.

## Why Scraps Cache

| Principle              | What it means                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Private by default** | Ordinary use and device sync never send plaintext notes to the relay. Hosted MCP is a separate opt-in access path. |
| **E2E encrypted sync** | Multi-device sync always encrypts on the client. The relay stores opaque ciphertext only.                          |
| **Self-hosted**        | Run the app and relay yourself. One Node process, one SQLite database.                                             |
| **Local-first data**   | Notes live in the browser (IndexedDB). Day-to-day use does not require the network.                                |
| **Recoverable**        | Encrypted client backups (`.scraps-cache-backup`) can be exported and imported from the UI.                        |

## Features

- **Notes** — title, body, colors, pins, archive, trash
- **Checklists** — `[ ]` / `[x]` lines in the note body
- **Labels** — organize and filter notes
- **Reminders** — one on-device alert per reminder; sync can wake every enabled device without sending note content
- **Attachments** — photos and files; images optimized client-side (EXIF stripped)
- **Kanban** — boards with custom backlog filters
- **Search** — local full-text style filtering on your device
- **Sync** — pair devices with a short code; payloads are always E2E encrypted; server stores ciphertext only
- **Hosted MCP** — optional premium AI access with a separate trust model; the server decrypts requested notes in memory and the AI provider receives them
- **Workspaces** — keep several sync keys on one device, each with its own isolated notes, plus an anonymous workspace that never syncs
- **Backups** — passphrase-protected client exports and imports
- **PWA** — installable shell with a service worker

## Quick start (development)

Requires **Node.js 24** (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/volturine/scrapscache.git
cd scrapscache
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/` (or your LAN / Tailscale IP on port `5173`).

```sh
npm run validate   # check + format + tests + production build
npm run build && npm start   # production Node adapter on port 3000 by default
```

## Self-host (Docker)

The recommended production path pulls the multi-arch image from GitHub Container Registry:

```sh
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env
# Edit docker/.env: set SCRAPSCACHE_IMAGE, SCRAPSCACHE_ADMIN_TOKEN, and SCRAPSCACHE_ORIGIN for public HTTPS
docker compose --project-directory . -f docker/compose.yaml --env-file docker/.env pull
docker compose --project-directory . -f docker/compose.yaml --env-file docker/.env up -d
```

App: `http://localhost:3000` (or the origin you configured).

To preview a published PR image (`dev-<n>`) beside production, use
`docker/compose.dev.yaml` on port **3000** — see [self-hosting](docs/self-hosting.md#preview-a-pull-request-image).

Private HTTPS on your tailnet (no public ports): add
`docker/compose.tailscale.yaml` — see [self-hosting](docs/self-hosting.md#tailscale-serve).

| Tag                             | When                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `latest`                        | Push/merge to `master` (current production build) |
| `master`                        | Same as above                                     |
| `sha-<commit>`                  | Non-PR publishes (immutable)                      |
| `<version>` / `<major>.<minor>` | Git tags like `v1.2.3`                            |
| `dev-<n>` / `dev-sha-<commit>`  | Pull requests only (never overwrites `latest`)    |

Prefer a **pinned release tag or digest**, not floating `latest`, for production.

## How ordinary sync privacy works (short)

```text
┌─────────────┐     encrypted envelopes      ┌──────────────────┐
│  Browser    │ ───────────────────────────► │  Sync relay      │
│  IndexedDB  │ ◄─────────────────────────── │  SQLite (opaque) │
│  (plaintext │     ciphertext only          │  no note content │
│   locally)  │                              └──────────────────┘
└─────────────┘
```

1. Notes are created and stored **locally**.
2. When sync is used, the client **always** encrypts payloads with a device-held
   sync key (XChaCha20-Poly1305) before upload.
3. Pairing transfers that key between devices using a short code and **CPace**
   (PAKE) so the relay never sees the key in the clear.
4. User-triggered **backups** are encrypted with Argon2id + a passphrase in the
   browser.

Hosted MCP does not use this end-to-end trust boundary. When an operator enables it and a
user grants access, the server unwraps the sync key and decrypts requested notes in ephemeral
memory so the AI provider can read or change them. Revoking MCP invalidates its credentials;
users who never enable it remain on the ciphertext-only sync path.

## Status

Scraps Cache is under active development. APIs and on-disk formats may evolve; releases
aim to keep backup import and sync recoverable across supported versions.
